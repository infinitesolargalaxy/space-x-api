Our web application consists of five views: a home landing page, and three views which displays the results of a vehicle, launch, and launchpad query with each of the results as a card, and finally, a login page is there for user to log in or sign up to the web application.
The primary feature of our web application is to look at SpaceXâ€™s updated list of spacecraft or history of launches in an easy to use manner. The intention is to serve as a SpaceX fan site.
On each card of vehicles, launches, and launchpads, there are links to each other such that a vehicle card has links to its launches, launch card has links to its launched vehicle and its launchpad used, and a launchpad card has links to launches occurred to it.
Also, when users log in, they can add new results such as a new launchpad to the wep application, edit an existing result, or delete a result using buttons present in the results section. It can be also done using curl. Using curl, a user can also post messages and the posted messages will be displayed at the top of the web application in the order of posted id on the results pages.

Some of the features of our web application is its responsiveness to the user. With different screen sizes such as mobile phone or tablet, our navigation bar turns into a toggle mode or a full view. Also, the results display in the form of a card changes between  a card in each row to 3 columns of cards in each row, providing better readability, and clicking space-x logo at the bottom directs to its homepage.
Our end-user would be someone who's a fan of SpaceX and they would use the web application to easily browse SpaceX's data on its launches, spacecraft, and historical launchpads, and add their own results to each list and having it be persistently stored and loaded from the server.
